My name is Tamene TOLESSA and I got a BSc in Agriculture and MSc in Plant Science (Plant Breeding) in Ethiopia. I have served the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research as a legume breeder from junior to Associate Researcher. I have also served the International Livestock Research Institute, one of the CGIAR Centre based in Addis as Research Associate. Currently I am a PhD student and my research thesis work is aimed at: i) Annotation of transposable elements (TEs) in myrtle rust (Puccinia psidii) genome, ii) Annotation and diversity analysis of NBS-LRR gene family in Eucalyptus species, and iii) Identification of specific resistance gene(s) in Eucalyptus against myrtle rust (Puccinia psidii) pathogen
