Abigail is an Honours student with Team Schwessinger, who came to ANU from the 
University of Tasmania. She is investigating the impacts of fungicides on the wheat
microbiome using amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics, and also the potential for
biocontrol of fungal pathogens using Actinobacteria. During her undergraduate at UTas,
Abigail majored in microbiology, so she gets excited about getting into the lab and 
working hands-on with bacteria and fungi. She enjoys discovering the ways that microbes
respond to the world around them, understanding how and why they do what they do, and 
how we can use this information to solve real-world problems.

In her down time, Abigail loves cooking (and eating), tending to both her indoor and 
outdoor gardens, and going on adventures with her husband.
