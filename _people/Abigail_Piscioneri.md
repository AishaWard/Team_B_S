I’m a Bachelor of Science graduate from the University of Tasmania, majoring in
microbiology. I’m joining Team Schwessinger as a Summer Scholar, looking at the
microbiome of wheat plants and how the community composition impacts the plants’
immune response to fungal pathogens. I love applying my scientific knowledge to real world
problems, and getting to combine my love of plants and all things green with my love of the
microscopic world is exciting!
