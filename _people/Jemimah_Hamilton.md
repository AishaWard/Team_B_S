Jemimah is joining the Schwessinger Lab as a summer scholar in 2019 and honours student in 2020. She is working in collaboration with the Nicotra Lab on the genome sequencing and interpretation of the alpine Waxy Bluebell, Wahlenbergia ceracea. W. ceracea research is being used to predict the impacts of climate change on alpine environments, as well as other biomes through comparison across the genus.
Jemimah moved to ANU in order to study a double degree in Genetics and Politics, Philosophy & Economics. Over her degree she has shifted to prioritising plants, as she is captivated by their creative biochemical solutions to the challenge of being earthbound. She is excited to work in the Schwessinger Lab because of their dedication to quality research and depth of understanding.
