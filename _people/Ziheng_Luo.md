I am a master student of Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics and going to have a research year working on myrtle rust differentiation. I was a pure biological student in the undergraduate study but now I am developing my skill in programming to explore the bioinformatic world. I am passionate about research, traveling, sports and delicious food!
