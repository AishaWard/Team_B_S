Having studied an eclectic mix of physics and maths to begin their undergraduate, Tavish transferred to biology and chemistry, majoring in Biochemistry and specialising in Genetics at the Australian National University. Along the way, they joined the Schwessinger Group first as a summer scholar in late 2018, and found a passion for bioinformatics and fungi, continuing on in the lab for the next 8 months. 
They now work as an Honours student, assessing the potential for the application of machine learning techniques to long read metabarcoding on the Oxford Nanopore Technologiesâ€™ MinION device, utilising neural networks to increase the speed and accuracy of species identification compared to more traditional morphological and BLAST-based techniques. They plan to continue to develop this through external projects and hope to stay on with the Schwessinger lab for further study.
