Tavish is a PhD student with Team Schwessinger, having come through the ANU and worked with the team since 2018. They have worked on applying machine learning techniques to long read metabarcoding DNA data from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, with the aim to develop a novel technique for fungal pathogen identification. They are looking forward to learning more about microbiomes as they analyse the data from koalas as they return to bushfire affected habitat.
