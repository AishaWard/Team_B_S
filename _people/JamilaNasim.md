I am a Masters student and began my studies with Benjamin in 2019. My interests are mainly in studying DNA modifications. My main focus will be basically focusing on the role of methylation in regulation genes and TE expressions in haustoria of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. Tritici (Pst) a wheat rust fungus.
