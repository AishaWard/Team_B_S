I’m a Masters student visiting from the University of Queensland, currently working on refining a method for conducting gene interaction assays using wheat protoplasts.  This method has potential for use in screening effector candidates and investigating the molecular interactions involved in infection and effector triggered immunity.

I’m interested in all the weird and wonderful ways that organisms interact with each other and the fascinating strategies they employ to survive.

One of my favourite things about the Schwessinger lab has been learning from colleagues with a wide variety of scientific backgrounds.  I am excited about learning new techniques and creating an open and welcoming environment in the lab.
