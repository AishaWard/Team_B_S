Salome is a PhD student, currently working on refining a method for conducting gene interaction assays using wheat protoplasts. This method has potential for use in screening effector candidates and investigating the mechanisms involved in infection and effector triggered immunity.

Salome is interested in understanding how organisms interact with each other and the diversity of strategies they employ to survive. She is excited about learning new techniques and creating an open and welcoming environment in the lab.

Outside of the office, Salome loves all sorts of crafts and DIY, road trips and spending time in her garden.
