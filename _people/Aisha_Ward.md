My name is Aisha and I am the Lab Technician for the Schwessinger lab. I started working for the lab in early 2019 and am currently completing my Bachelor of Genetics at the ANU and have interests in both plant disease and immune response.
I have previously completed work experience at CSIRO and participated in the RSB Summer Internship program, where I discovered my passion for wet-labs, and lab work in general. As a lab tech, I love that I am exposed to, and can assist in a variety of projects, and I have found that this has greatly broadened my knowledge in this field.
Being a part of the Schwessinger Lab has been an absolute blast, with everyone being so warm and welcoming and determined to produce great science!
