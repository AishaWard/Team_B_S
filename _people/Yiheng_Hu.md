I am a PhD student from China trying to solve the question about how the incidence of the fungal pathogen and its associated microbial community changes during one or multi-year infection cycle. I am a nanopore technology fan so I hope I could also make some contribution on developing on-site sequencing platform for pathogen detection. Other than research, my interest spreads from different kinds of food, to many outdoor activities including fishing, hiking, skiing and mountaineering.
