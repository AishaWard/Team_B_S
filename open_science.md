### Retractions and errors in Science

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/people/MinION.jpg">  

Retractions are often a difficult, stigmatised and frustrating process for researchers. If it, however, regrettably happens, responding in the way that Benjamin and his lab did when retracting a paper in 2015 was able to rebuild scientific trust and respect in the community for their lab once more, and is now considered an excellent example of how retractions and mistakes in science can be handled.
