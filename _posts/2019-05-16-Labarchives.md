Proper documentation of results is essential in a lab place, to ensure reproducibility and accuracy when making scientific conclusions, or when looking to get your paper published.
As such, the Research School of Biology is endeavouring to introduce LabArchives, an electronic lab notebook, into how we collect and store data.

The ANU LabArchives login can be found [here](https://aushib.labarchives.com?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fidp2.anu.edu.au%2Fidp%2Fshibboleth).

An introduction to how to use LabArchives can be found [here](_______________).
