What to bring: Yourselves! We will be carpooling to the venue at 2:00pm from RSB, then coming back to ANU for a happy hour/potluck. Feel free to bring friends and family to this and please bring something to share!

Remember, ideally we will be taking lab team pictures, so dress up how you would like to be photographed!

Hope to see all of Team Schwessinger there!
