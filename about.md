### About us
We are a highly collaborative and interactive team that studies the interaction of fungi and plants. We use a wide varity of tools reaching from biochemistry, bioinformatics, genomics, to environmental sampling. Modern biology is best mixed by combining good 'old school' biochemistry with modern data science stired with interesting biological questions.

### How to join our Team
Please see [How to Join](http://Team-Schwessinger.github.io/Team_B_S/how_to_join/) for more information.

### Research
We study these plant-fungi interactions on multiple molecular and temporal scales. This includes many aspects:

Detailed molecular interaction studies of plant and fungal proteins leading to disease or immunity. The seconds to days timescale.
Detailed genome evolution and adaptation of fungal pathogens, especially the [wheat stripe rust fungus](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14159?scrollTo=references&), in response to wild and agricultural ecosystems. The months to years timescale.
Detailed comparative and population genomics analysis of rust fungi with a focus on wheat rusts, yet looking beyond. The decades to millions of year timescale.

Our 2019 lab projects include: 

[Fungal genomics, evolution, and host adaptation](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/projects/fungal-genomics-evolution-and-host-adaptation) (Summer, Honours, Master, and PhD students)

[Detection of fungal pathogens and their associated microbiome](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/projects/detection-fungal-pathogens-and-their-associated-microbiome) (Summer, Honours, and Master students)

### The science beyond the 'lab'
Beyond being nerds, we aim to contribute to a welcoming and progressive academic environment. Group members are actively encouraged to contribute to community events, outreach science communication, and university commities. For example, group members are part of [eLife's Early Career Advisory Board](https://elifesciences.org/), ambassador for the protocol sharing webpage [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/), and chair of the RSB Equity Committee. And of course we love open access and reproducible science.
