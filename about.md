### About us
We are a highly collaborative and interactive team that studies the interaction of fungi and plants. We use a wide variety of tools reaching from biochemistry, bioinformatics, genomics, to environmental sampling. Modern biology is best mixed by combining good 'old school' biochemistry with modern data science stirred with interesting biological questions.

### Research

Our team focuses on questions around plant biosecurity in Australia by studying the interaction between plants and their fungal pathogen. Specifically, we work on agronomic important wheat rust fungi and the environmental important myrtle rust fungus that infects a wide range of myrtacea (e.g. eucalyptus trees). We also have an interest in bioinformatics and sequencing technologies in relation to plant sciences, and are currently doing research into MinION sequencing ability and error.

**Key questions are:**

* How do these invasive fungal pathogens infect host plants?
* What are the genes underlying host adaptation enabling infection?
* How does evolution and adaptation shape genome structure in agricultural vs. natural ecosystems?
* Can we develop cutting edge sequence based methods for pathogen detection?
* How do microbial communities in plant leaves change during the infection with invasive pathogens?

Many of these questions are also applicable to other study systems, hence we are a really collaborative team. We work with other groups at RSB and beyond on plant, animal, and fungal genomics. 

**Specifics**

We study plant-fungi interactions on multiple molecular and temporal scales. This includes many aspects:

* Detailed molecular interaction studies of plant and fungal proteins leading to disease or immunity. The seconds to days timescale.
* Detailed genome evolution and adaptation of fungal pathogens, especially the [wheat stripe rust fungus](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14159?scrollTo=references&), in response to wild and agricultural ecosystems. The months to years timescale.
* Detailed comparative and population genomics analysis of rust fungi with a focus on wheat rusts, yet looking beyond. The decades to millions of year timescale.

Our 2019 lab projects include: 

[Fungal genomics, evolution, and host adaptation](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/projects/fungal-genomics-evolution-and-host-adaptation) (Summer, Honours, Master, and PhD students)

[Detection of fungal pathogens and their associated microbiome](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/projects/detection-fungal-pathogens-and-their-associated-microbiome) (Summer, Honours, and Master students)

**Our experience with MinION sequencing:**

Evolution has driven genetic diversity of life on Earth, but also created highly complex genomes that are difficult to sequence. Current draft genomes can have thousands to hundreds of thousands of contigs rather than chromosomes, containing incorrect assemblies, gaps and errors. With rapid advances in long-read technologies, it is becoming possible to resolve complex genomes, including repetitive, polyploid plant genomes. Despite the technology being available, a challenge persists: the extraction of pure high molecular weight DNA suitable for long-read sequencing. This is particularly true of recalcitrant native Australian trees such as Eucalypts and Acacias. To resolve this, firstly we optimised a density gradient based nuclei extraction to remove cytoplasmic secondary metabolites, phenols and limit reads from high copy count plastid genomes. Secondly, we optimised a gentle high molecular weight DNA extraction free of columns and high centrifugation, to limit DNA fragmentation. Finally, the DNA was purified and size selected by gel electrophoresis. For sequencing, we adopted the portable MinION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Using these approaches, we have been obtaining  approximately 10 gigabases of sequencing from a single MinION revC flow cell and approximately 15 gigabases with new revD flow cells. This includes quality reads over 200 kb in length, average N50 values of 20 kb and some N50 values exceeding 45 kb. Such ultra-long reads assist the assembly of high quality genomes, from telomere to telomere.

### The science beyond the 'lab'
Beyond being nerds, we aim to contribute to a welcoming and progressive academic environment. Group members are actively encouraged to contribute to community events, outreach science communication, and university commities. For example, group members are part of [eLife's Early Career Advisory Board](https://elifesciences.org/), ambassador for the protocol sharing webpage [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/), and chair of the RSB Equity Committee. And of course we love open access and reproducible science.
